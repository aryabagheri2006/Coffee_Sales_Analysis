# Coffee_Sales_Analysis
Coffee Sales Analysis (excel)
This project analysed coffee sales data from 2019 to 2022, providing insights into customer behaviour, product preferences, and geographic sales distribution. Using Excel, I developed an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore sales trends, customer demographics, and product details. The dashboard includes:
•	KPIs and Trends: Monthly sales trends for different coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta) over the years, helping identify seasonal patterns and popular products.
•	Sales by Country: A breakdown of total sales by country, showing the United States as the leading market, followed by Ireland and the United Kingdom.
•	Top Customers: Displays the top five customers by sales revenue, highlighting key customers and loyalty patterns.
•	Interactive Filters: Filters for order date, roast type, coffee size, and loyalty card status, enabling detailed data exploration based on specific criteria.
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of coffee sales, supporting targeted marketing and sales strategies by identifying key markets, popular products, and high-value customers
